# Low Battery Notifier

Lets you know when the battery on your macbook is running out of juice.

For some reason, when the battery on Macbook Pros (Late 2013) starts to deteriorate, lasting a couple of hours instead of eight, the built-in low battery notification stops working ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. This exists to fix that.

This program checks the battery charge level on Apple Macbooks and gives an
auditory alarm when the battery level falls below a given threshold (charge
percentage). Then it will notify again every minute until the laptop is
charging again or it runs out of power.

Have a look at the `battery-level-notifier` file for usage instructions.
